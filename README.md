# wpf

A public Repo to help acquire WPF knowledge.

As this is a repo purely for learning, the commits may meander a little in style.  This isn't intended
to be production quality or as strict as my portfolio work.

I don't want to restrict my creativity or hide my mistakes - please make allowances!
