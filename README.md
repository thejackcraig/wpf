# wpf

A public Repo to help acquire WPF knowledge.

As this is a repo purely for learning, the commits may meander a little in style.  This isn't intended
to be production quality or as strict as my portfolio work.

I don't want to restrict my creativity or hide my mistakes - please make allowances!


# proposed structure

controls\
This will be one solution composed of many small projects, each one focusing on one particular control.
The primary goal is to learn and demonstrate basic knowledge of the common controls, nothing particular clever
or obscure. More complex controls like Ribbon will also be included as/when appropriate. 

mvvm\
This will be a series of solutions which look into the pros and cons of different approaches to MVVM.  The goal
will be simplicity and consistency.  Thirdparty tools will be looked at and critically evaluated.

animation\
I want to learn about this as it will be fun but hopefully will server a serious purpose too.

styles\
This is an important topic, getting this right is important in ensuring the WPF apps I write are readable

apps\
This part of the repo will be for various test apps which attempt to draw together aspects of the sections above
into some useful form
